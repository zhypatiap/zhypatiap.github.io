<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Currently, I am a fourth year PhD Candidate in the <a href="https://hspop.uw.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Department of Health Systems &amp; Population Health</a> at the University of Washington (UW) and a trainee in the <a href="https://csde.washington.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">UW Center for Studies in Demography &amp; Ecology</a>.</p> <p>I am a mixed methods health services researcher with training in epidemiology, biostatistics, demography, and health policy. My broad research interests are related to understanding how people make reproductive health decisions while navigating multi-level barriers and varied information sources (including social media, clinical providers, etc.) to better support people in making decisions that align with their preferences. I have a special interest in understanding how people with chronic conditions and disabled people navigate these decisions.</p> <p>I joined the Health Services PhD program in 2021. For my first three years in the program, I was a research assistant with the <a href="https://obgyn.uw.edu/research/va-uw" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">VA/UW Womenâ€™s Health Services Research</a> team led by Dr. Lisa Callegari and Dr. Kristen Gray.</p> <p>In July 2024, I received an <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/UjMXRPzu9UyRzqw9G7JK_A/project-details/10821973" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">F31 predoctoral fellowship</a> from the National Institutes of Health to continue working with Dr. Gray, Dr. Callegari, and others from VA Puget Sound and the UW on my dissertation using mixed methods to understanding how to improve access, quality, and equity of contraceptive care for Veterans with autoimmune conditions. I also received a VA Puget Sound Predoctoral Fellowship to support my dissertation and study infertility diagnosis and fertility treatment inequities among Veterans.</p> <p>Starting the summer of 2024, I have been working with Dr. Sarah Munro and Dr. Logan Trenaman on their <a href="https://societyfp.org/awarded_grants/societal-preferences-for-access-to-abortion-among-texas-residents-capturing-tradeoffs-using-a-discrete-choice-experiment/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Society of Family Planning funded project</a> exploring preferences of Texas residents related to traveling for abortion care using qualitative methods and a preference solitication survey.</p> <p>In 2023, I received a grant from the <a href="https://societyfp.org/awarded_grants/is-tiktok-the-new-contraceptive-counselor-insights-from-an-analysis-of-contraceptive-side-effects-discourse-on-tiktok/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Society of Family Planning</a> with Brooke Whitfield (UT-Austin), Dr. Betsy Pleasants (UNC, Chapel Hill), and Dr. Laura Lindberg (Rutgers) to study how contraceptive side effects are discussed on TikTok and what insights the social media platform could provide clinicians and public health researchers about the importance and salience of contraceptive side effects.</p> <p>I was born and raised in San Francisco, CA. I received my BS in Neuroscience from <a href="https://nbb.emory.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Emory University</a> and an MPH from <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/sociomedical-sciences" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health</a>.
